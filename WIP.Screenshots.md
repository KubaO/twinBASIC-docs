# Screenshots — `shoot_docs.mjs`

The documentation's IDE screenshots go stale with every beta. `scripts/shoot_docs.mjs` retakes
them from a live IDE: every picture of the IDE the documentation holds, annotations included,
and the program windows and web pages that sit beside them. The owner's decisions behind it are
dated 2026-10-08 onward.

## What there is to retake

Every menu, dialog, panel and editor view of the IDE is HTML in the IDE's page, so all are
reachable over CDP; annotations (arrows, boxes, rings, numbers, labels) are drawn on top by the
tool, and a composite is assembled from several clips. Running programs' windows and a few web
pages are taken beside them.

### Pictures still outside the tool

Ten images under `docs/`, each for a stated reason:

- **The six GitHub walkthrough pictures** of `Documentation/Building.md` (compare-changes,
  create-pull-request, merge-pull-request, confirm-merge, choose-workflow, run-workflow): the
  owner's to retake by hand, with a signed-in account (owner, 2026-10-09); no agent touches them
  or their prose. They show base `main` and the old workflow name, and confirm-merge an e-mail
  address, until then.
- **`packPublishPackage1`**: `packagePublisherPublish` opens the sign-in form when no publisher
  is signed in, before the confirmation box, and a package is never actually published, so the
  old file stays. **`packPublishComplete1`** is the result of a real publish, so it stays too.
- **`Tutorials/WebView2/Images/tbWebView2InAForm.gif`** is skipped (owner).
- **`favicon.png`** is never changed by this work (owner).

## Decisions (owner, 2026-10-08)

- **One tool.** `shoot_docs.mjs`; the help add-in's pictures are one setup among the others.
- **2x pictures, shown at half size**: every retaken picture gets `{:width="W" height="H"}` (half
  its pixel size) on its page, as `docs/IDE/AddIns/Help.md` has. A JPG retaken becomes a PNG.
- **Menus are transparent cut-outs**, as today: the bar item and its drop-downs opaque, the rest
  alpha 0.
- **Annotations are redrawn by the tool in one house style**, anchored to what they point at,
  including the ones that only repeat the prose.
- **Composites are assembled by the tool** from element clips.
- **`fafaloneIDEscreenshot1.png`** (a community author's own annotated picture) and its downscaled
  copy are replaced by a project-made full-IDE feature map with the same labels.

## The IDE the tool drives

Measured on BETA 997:

- **Fixed device scale.** The IDE page otherwise takes the host's scaling (1.5 on the dev box:
  `body.scale150`, 22.67 px menu rows). `--force-device-scale-factor=1` in the WebView2 browser
  arguments (`Lane`'s `browserArgs`) gives `scale100` and integer sizes;
  `Emulation.setDeviceMetricsOverride` at `deviceScaleFactor: 2` then gives a clean 2x. Menus and
  dialogs come out at the CSS sizes of the pictures taken before the fix to the pixel (File
  189x336, Manage Keyboard Shortcuts 1016x736).
- **No-project start.** `Lane.open` always opens a project. `Lane.openNoProject()`
  (`launchOnDesktop` with no argument, then `attachIde`) starts the IDE as it shows its splash and
  then New / Open Project, with every menu in its no-project state. The lane's copy of the
  install leaves out `projects\` (29 MB): New Project then shows 2 templates and no samples, so
  a setup that shows them copies `projects\` into the lane's copy.
- **Theme** (owner, 2026-10-09). Every picture is taken in the dark theme
  (`tbTheme_SwitchToDarkMode`) as `X.png`, byte for byte the picture it always was, and in the
  **Light** theme (`tbTheme_SwitchToLightMode`, not Classic) as `X.light.png` beside it. The
  site shows the light one in its light theme and the dark one in its dark theme, following the
  toggle and, with no choice stored, the OS; pages are not edited, the build pairs the files by
  name ([WIP.Build.md, Pictures in two themes](WIP.Build.md#pictures-in-two-themes)); the PDF
  has the light ones only. The menu bar and dialog title bars follow the theme; drop-downs and
  dialog bodies are light in every theme. Light lays the window out a few pixels differently
  (the toolbar 4 CSS px shorter, a panel's title bar 3, the Global Search button narrower), so
  a light picture can be a few pixels off the dark one's size; the build shows each at its own
  size, at one scale.
- **Opening things.** Menus open on a real mouse press on `#rootMenu<Title>`; submenus on a real
  mouse move onto the item (~500 ms; wait for `#contextMenuSUB > .contextMenuItem`). Dialogs by
  `executeIdeCommand` (`tbHelp_ShowAboutWindow`, `tbIde_ShowIDEOptions`,
  `tbKeyboardShortcuts_ShowManageKeyboardShortcuts`, `tbPanels_ShowManagePanelLayouts`,
  `tbProject_New`, `tbToolbox_ShowMoreComponents`), closed by a real click on their Close /
  Cancel / OK button.
- **What the user's machine leaks into a picture**, and the answer for each:
  - the recent-projects lists (twinBASIC and VB6) read the user's registry: overridden in the
    page (`HostGetRecentsList`, `HostGetVB6RecentProjects`), nothing read or written;
  - the IDE's settings (View's ticks, IDE Options' values, the debugger options, the language
    tick, user panel layouts) live in `HKCU\...\twinBASIC_IDE\IDESettings`, not in the lane's
    private APPDATA — see Machine state in the pictures;
  - the licence line on About (`LICENCE: tB Licence: NOT READY` when the licence check has not
    finished) — the same section;
  - the Windows user name: the existing visible-text check stays and covers every picture.

## Capture

- **Opaque clip**: `Page.captureScreenshot` with a clip, snapped outward to whole device pixels
  (`floor(v*2)/2`, `ceil((v+w)*2)/2`). Dialogs clip `.modalDialogContainer` (its 40 px shadow
  falls outside).
- **Cut-out**: a style sheet sets `html, body, #bodyInner` transparent and `body *` hidden
  except the kept elements (`#rootMenu<Title>`, `#contextMenu`, `#contextMenuSUB`, or an
  annotation layer), plus `Emulation.setDefaultBackgroundColorOverride` to alpha 0; both undone
  after. Verified: corners alpha 0, interior 255, the rounded bottom corners partial.
- **Quiet page**: the existing style sheet against carets and animations goes into every shot,
  opaque ones included (the probe's IDE Options sample showed a caret without it).
- **Write only on change**: kept from the current tool. The tool prints, for each picture, the
  `{:width height}` its page should have and warns where the page disagrees; it does not edit
  markdown.
- **A capture is not byte-stable.** `Page.captureScreenshot` of an unchanged screen alternates
  between versions a few pixels apart by 1-14 grey levels: dialog shadow edges, the status bar's
  scaled Ko-fi bitmap, panel dividers, rounded corners. `captureBeyondViewport` and
  `fromSurface: false` are stable but drop the scrollbars and the cut-outs' alpha, so neither is
  usable. `capture` waits 1 s before the first capture (without it rounded-corner pixels come out a
  grey level off and stay so), then takes up to 8, 150 ms apart: it keeps one equal to the file on
  disk, else the first two in a row that agree, and fails if none agree. So a picture is rewritten
  when the IDE draws something different, not when the noise flips.
  Under the full parallel load a run now and then settles on the other version of one or two
  pictures (1-3 grey levels, a few pixels to a few hundred along an edge) and keeps it through
  every capture, so a longer wait in `capture` does not help; each is unchanged when its setup
  runs alone, and which one varies from run to run. So **a picture within a capture's noise of
  its file is left as it is** (`nearly`: one size, no channel more than 16 levels apart, at most
  0.5% of the pixels apart), reported `unchanged but for a capture's noise`, with a `.noise`
  picture under `--diffs`. The same test decides that a light picture is the dark one.
- **Settle by condition, not by sleep.** Fixed sleeps were most of a run (a closed menu leaves a
  2x8 px empty `#contextMenu`, so a wait for it to vanish always ran out its 2 s; ~3,000 calls).
  A menu is closed when it holds no items; a dialog is still when a MutationObserver has seen no
  change and its images and fonts are loaded; a floated panel when the IDE's `.flashElement` class
  is gone; a help page when its fonts, images and body are settled. The page size is set only once
  `body` has its `scale100` class: the IDE picks 48 or 32 px New Project tiles from it.
- **A picture that shows state sets that state itself** rather than relying on the shots before it,
  so a picture is the same whichever IDE or order takes it.

## Annotations

An SVG layer the tool adds to the IDE page above everything (`z-index` max,
`pointer-events: none`), drawn in CSS pixels, so it scales with the 2x capture and survives a
cut-out as a kept element.

**Anchors**, resolved in the page at shot time:
- an element: a CSS selector, optionally narrowed by its text (`{css: ".buttonGroupItem", text: "Samples"}`);
- a span of code in the editor: a text search in the model (`{code: "NormalState", nth: 2}`), placed
  with `editor.getScrolledVisiblePosition`, never a line number;
- a point of a rect: `center`, an edge or corner, with an offset (`{of: anchor, at: "top-left", dx, dy}`).

**Primitives**: `arrow` (from, to; `bend` for a curve; several `to` for a fork), `box` (a row),
`ring` (an icon or a short word; a box with `rx` half its height), `underline`, `label` (text
beside an anchor: `left`/`right`/`above`/`below`), `badge` (a number).

**House style** (CSS px at 1x): one red, `#E5252A`; 3 px strokes, round caps and joins, with a
1 px white halo so a stroke reads on light and dark UI; one solid triangular head, 5x the stroke
long; boxes and rings 3 px with 4 px padding; labels in the page's font (Segoe UI) 600 at 15 px on a pill (dark red
with white text over dark UI, white with red text over light); badges a filled red circle of
22 px with a white bold numeral. The dark pill is `#8E161A`. No hollow block arrows, no hand-drawn strokes. **A label's
tone follows the theme** unless the shot names one: dark in the dark theme, light in Light,
read from the page's panel colour. Every label today sits on what follows the theme (a panel's
ground, the window), so none names a tone; one over a drop-down or a dialog's body, light in
every theme, would say `tone: "light"`.

**Composites** (the five CustomControls code-to-property pictures, `Editor.png`, `DebugConsole.png`):
each part is captured as its own clip; the tool then lays the parts out in a full-window layer
in the same page (`<img>` of each part on a plain background, with a gap), maps each part's
anchors through its placement, draws the overlay across, and captures the layer.
**Native `<select>` lists** (Editor.png's four, a FAQ picture, one tutorial) open in an OS
window no CDP capture holds: the tool draws a replica list from the select's options, styled
as the IDE's own pop-up list, beside the select.

## The tool

`scripts/shoot_docs.mjs [--only <regex>] [--out <dir>] [--port N] [--ide <path>] [--jobs N] [--diffs <dir>] [--svg]`,
Exit codes: 0 every picture written or unchanged, 1 a picture failed, 2 the tool could not run,
3 not put back.

- **Setups**: one IDE each --- `no-project` (menus, dialogs, panels), `help` (the add-in's eight,
  `test/addin/helpdemo`), `project`, `sample`, the `settings` setups, `glyphs`, `global-search`
  (Sample 15 exported from the install, built into the lane's copy as an add-in, its own project
  opened), `sample6` (Sample 6 exported and opened) and `designer` (the sample fixture with
  `test/shots/designer/` staged onto it, plus the Global Search add-in for Toolbar_3; it sets the
  page's `currentDPI` to the 2x ratio, or the IDE's 5 s DPI check covers every designer with
  RESYNC), and `forms` (the same without the add-in), `community` (the demo, its compiler
  restarted on an empty licence key in the page) and `splash` (the demo, for the splash
  alone), `programs`, `codelens`, `package` and `fusion` (pictures of a running program),
  `package-server`, `settings-linked` and `package-check`, `import`, `webpage` and `web` (a
  Chrome, not an IDE), `featuremap`, `customcontrols`, `code` and `sample9` (all described
  below). A setup is `{name, start, prepare}`.
  Every add-in a setup loads has its `SaveSetting` key snapshotted, emptied and restored
  (`tbDocsHelp`, `GlobalSearchAddIn`).
- **Jobs**: `--jobs N` (default 6) runs setups at once, each IDE on its own claimed ports and
  private desktop, and splits the big setups into parts, longest first; a full run is about
  200 s in both themes (the jobs add up to about 1,250 s per theme, so six IDEs cannot do much better).
  `--jobs 1` runs one IDE per setup in table order. Per-run
  state lives on the connection (`c.shot`), never in module variables.
- **Diffs**: `--diffs <dir>` (never under `docs/`) writes, for each picture that differs from the
  file on disk, the committed picture, the new one and an amplified difference map side by side
  (`scripts/lib/shot-diff.mjs`, `composeComparison` with `amplify` in `scripts/lib/png.mjs`).
- **Shots**: a table of `{out, setup, take, annotate?}`, `out` the picture's path under
  `docs/`; `--only` matches it or its `.light.png`, and selects the shot in both themes.
  `take(ctx)` brings the IDE to the state and returns the clip (or the parts of a composite);
  `annotate` is a list of primitives.
- **Two themes**: each job takes its shots in dark, then `backToPrepared` (no menu
  or dialog, the tabs opened since closed with their changes discarded, the Tabs List's
  Recently Closed as it was, and the keys the takes added to `ctx` dropped), the IDE switched to
  Light by `tbTheme_SwitchToLightMode` (`ensureTheme`, settled by the panels' colour, the
  page's images and fonts), and the same shots again: no second IDE start. A shot that leaves
  something only it can undo puts it back itself: `Help_Window` attaches the help again with
  the window's Attach, `addReport` opens the report the dark pass added rather than adding
  another. A light picture with no file yet prefers a capture equal to the dark picture while
  its first is within a capture's noise of it; one with the dark picture's pixels is not kept (a light
  file there is removed); one more than 32 device pixels off the dark one's size fails, since
  that is a wrong state, not the theme. `--diffs` names a file `<path>.dark…` or
  `<path>.light…`; the run ends with a count per theme of each state.
- Shared helpers: `openMenu`, `hoverItem`, `closeMenus`, `waitModal`, `closeModal`, the cut-out,
  the snap.

## Standing rules for what a picture shows (owner, 2026-10-09)

- **A state is reproduced as the IDE reaches it, never by editing what it draws.** The tool
  inspects the IDE's page first to see how a state can be reached.
- **A picture of a running program comes from a program written to illustrate what the picture
  depicts, run while the picture is taken.** A running program's window is taken once, as the
  program draws it.
- **Network access is fine for the package-server pictures. Never actually publish a package**;
  everything short of that is allowed.
- **A picture not of the IDE is retaken where it can be reproduced.** A `.vbp` import uses a
  synthetic `.vbp` project, and the path is scrubbed from the picture.
- **Licence and LIMITED states are reached only by a route that never touches the user's real
  licence**, or the old pictures stay.
- **Byte-identical pictures are one file**, each page keeping its own alt text.
- `Documentation/Building.md`'s "Editing screenshots" section points at `shoot_docs.mjs`.

## The feature map

`Features/Images/IDE-FeatureMap.png` (2880x1800, setup `featuremap`, fixture
`test/shots/featuremap/` FeatureTour) is a project-made full-IDE feature map. Twelve labels, each
anchored to an element or code span; Problems is labelled Diagnostics, its 997 title. Sticky
scroll, advanced hover info, inline hints, folding always shown and the debugger's memory figures
are switched on in the page only; the memory figures, which change from run to run, are fixed in
the page once real ones are shown, as History's times are.

## Special IDE states

- **`Services_Unavailable`**: the badge in the `no-project` setup. With no project the badge's
  title reads each service `Not initialized`; all four read `Disconnected` only for the 0.1 s
  between a compiler ending and the IDE starting the next.
- **`Splash_Screen`** is not a window of its own: it is the IDE's modal dialog
  (`showSplashWindow`, HTML in the page), shown only when the IDE starts with no project and
  closed after 2.5 s by a timer, which then shows New / Open Project. The shot calls
  `showSplashWindow` itself and holds the one 2.5 s timer the call starts until the capture,
  then runs it. It has a setup of its own (`splash`): the sponsors' logos are scaled one of two
  ways by what drew them earlier in the same IDE (8,795 pixels apart; in `no-project` by whether
  the start-up splash came before or after the 2x override, and in `project` About's light
  picture changed with the splash taken before it), and the New / Open Project dialog its close
  shows leaves the status bar's badges a pixel shorter for the shots after it.
- **`Licence_CommunityEdition`** (setup `community`): the IDE reads the key from IDESettings
  into the page's `licenceKey` and passes it to each compiler it starts; the compiler answers
  with the edition and hands the key back, and the IDE saves it only when it differs. The tool
  sets `licenceKey = ""` in the page and restarts the compiler with the toolbar's button: the
  registry value is never read, changed or removed by the tool, and the save call is one
  `PAGE_DEFAULTS` has made do nothing. `doCommunityNagScreens` runs; its only screen is dated
  1-7 January 2026.
- **`Services_Limited`** (setup `community`): LIMITED is never a lasting state. The page draws it
  for about 0.6 s while a compiler starts (its own connection up, the page then connecting FS,
  LSP and the debugger one after another, once the compiler has loaded the project). Closing one
  connection from the page is no route: the browser takes 60 s to close it (the compiler never
  answers the closing handshake), the IDE then draws LIMITED for 0.1 s, the compiler ends, and
  the IDE starts another. `Network.setBlockedURLs` does not stop a WebSocket, and throttling the
  page's CPU (`Emulation.setCPUThrottlingRate` 40) holds LIMITED but makes every evaluation time
  out. The shot holds the page's `fs.connect` call of a restart (the toolbar's button) until the
  capture and then makes it as the IDE did. The restart's DEBUG CONSOLE line names the project's
  folder, under the user's, and Clear does nothing until the compiler is connected, so
  `nameUserAsUserIn(c, ".debugConsoleOuter")` replaces the name there in the page; the console
  is cleared with its button once the compiler is back.
- **The tooltips** (`Services_Unavailable_Tooltip`, `Services_Operational_Tooltip`) are
  **replicas** (owner, 2026-10-10). A native
  `title` tooltip never appears on a private desktop: neither a CDP mouse move
  over the badge nor a `WM_MOUSEMOVE` posted or sent to any of the page's three windows
  (`Chrome_WidgetWin_0`, `Chrome_WidgetWin_1`, `Chrome_RenderWidgetHostHWND`) made a new
  top-level window appear in 3 s, and the page saw no hover from the messages. Real input
  reaches only the desktop on screen. So `tooltipOn` (`shoot_docs.mjs`) puts one `div` into the
  page, holding the badge's own `title` read live, styled by `TOOLTIP_CSS`, placed as Windows
  places a tooltip by the cursor (cursor taken at the badge's middle; the badge is at the
  window's bottom, so it goes above), captured alone and removed, in the badge's own setups
  (`project` for OPERATIONAL, `no-project` for UNAVAILABLE). Calibrated against the January
  pictures (154x73 and 158x73 px) by rendering the same text in puppeteer's Chrome at 1x: Segoe
  UI 12 px (9 pt), 16 px lines, `#242424` for the 1 px border **and** the text (the January
  pictures' darkest text pixel is 36 grey levels, not black), 7 px side padding, 3 above and 4
  below, the width rounded up to whole pixels. Result in a 1x render with the January text: the
  same size to the pixel and a mean luminance difference of 0.4 grey levels (maximum 9). In the
  IDE at 2x, shown at half size, OPERATIONAL is 158x73 like the January picture (its text a
  little softer than a 1x ClearType picture: mean difference 8 after a box-filter to 1x).
  **The text is the IDE's live one**: with no project the badge's title reads each service
  `Not initialized` (the January picture says `Disconnected`, the state for 0.1 s between
  compilers), so the UNAVAILABLE picture is 155x73 and its alt text says Not initialized. The
  replica does not follow the theme, so the Light pass takes the dark pixels and keeps no
  `.light.png` file.
- **Window capture, for the running programs and the Webpage pane**: `desktopWindows(desktop, {children})` and
  `captureWindow(desktop, hwnd, file, {flags})` in `tb-ide.mjs`, through `tb-launch.ps1`'s
  `TBBUILD_WINDOWS` mode (a thread put on the desktop with `SetThreadDesktop`, per-monitor DPI
  aware). On a private desktop `PrintWindow` with `PW_RENDERFULLCONTENT` (2) gives the IDE's
  window as drawn, WebView2 content included, and Notepad with its Windows 10 frame; flag 0 leaves
  the WebView2 areas white and black and draws a Windows 7 style frame. The picture is the
  window's rectangle at the desktop's DPI (144 here, so 1.5x, not 2x), including the invisible
  resize borders (`DWMWA_EXTENDED_FRAME_BOUNDS` would trim them). It returns the window's and
  its children's texts for the user-name check; text a window draws itself is not among them.
  About 0.5 s a call (a PowerShell start). The IDE's window class is `ThunderForm`; the Webpage
  pane's second WebView2 is a `Chrome_WidgetWin_1` child (title `Google`) of zero size until the
  pane shows. The capture also returns the visible frame (`DWMWA_EXTENDED_FRAME_BOUNDS`), the
  client area and a layered window's key and alpha. `tb-launch.ps1` is 28,576 characters of the
  30,000 its environment variable allows.

## Pictures of a running program

- **The program's window is captured by the harness** (`captureWindow`), not by the program:
  no fixture needs a capture module, and the frame is the system's.
- **Sizing.** The picture is the window's pixels at the desktop's DPI (144 here, 1.5x), cropped
  to its visible frame (the invisible resize borders are left out), and shown at its size at
  96 DPI: `keep` takes a `scale` from the shot (`{png, scale}`), 2 for every page picture.
  Not upscaled to 2x, which would add nothing. A run on a display at 100% writes 1x pictures
  with the same `{:width height}`. A shot is `once: true`: taken in the dark pass only, any
  `.light.png` removed; a job of them has no light pass.
- **Setup `programs`**: `test/shots/programs`, ShotPrograms, opened and built in the IDE; each
  picture starts the exe on a private desktop of its own (`launchOnDesktop`) with its command
  line naming the form, and the two take turns through files (`TB_SHOT_SIGNALS`: `shown`,
  `grow`, `grown`, `end`). An anchoring picture is one window before and after the program makes
  it 100 by 80 pixels larger (96 DPI), side by side 16 pixels apart on a transparent ground: no
  size pill, no hatched desktop. **The foreground is not dependable on a private desktop**: a program started on its own takes
  it and loses it again now and then, and one run from the IDE never gets it, so the form draws
  its frame as active (`WM_NCACTIVATE`) whenever it is not the foreground window; and no control
  takes the focus (`TabStop` off), since a focused one drew a caret or, now and then, a focus
  rectangle. With both, repeated runs are unchanged.
- **85f25aa2** (Opacity 75, TransparencyKey red): `PW_RENDERFULLCONTENT` draws the key colour
  black and every pixel opaque, so the tool reads the key's pixels from a client-only capture
  (flags 1) and gives the picture the window's own alpha (191) and alpha 0 there: the page is
  what lies under the form, a plain background in each site theme.
- **021f6cbf** is the project run from the IDE (F5) with `debugger.immediateMemoryInvalidation`
  and `debugger.runtimeCommandLineArguments` "listview" in the fixture's Settings: a Win32
  ListView whose column headers get the pointer of a String freed on return (`DanglingPtr`)
  shows rows of warning signs; built as an exe, the same code shows the old text.
- **CodeLens** (`b0724fe2`, `351d0147`; setup `codelens`, `test/shots/codelens`, CodeLensDemo):
  the bar clicked for real, the editor above the DEBUG CONSOLE in a layout set in the page. The
  line times (the page's clock for some lines, the compiler's for `Debug.Print`) and the time
  taken are set in the page once shown. `Scale factor` prints what the lane's compiler reads,
  1.50 on this machine.
- **`Toolbar_4`**: setup `designer`, the sample run with Start (`context.codeExecuting`) and
  stopped after.
- **`8d74d820`** (setup `package`) and **Fusion's `569099635`** (setup `fusion`): the paths the
  console names are on `PACKAGE_ROOT`, `\tbshots` at the root of the temp folder's drive
  (`Lane.open`'s `buildPath`; the fixture's `project.fusionBuildPath` in the staged copy),
  removed at the end unless it was there before.
- **A Fusion host needs a Fusion reference that holds an ActiveX control.** `settings-fusion`'s
  three Fusion references (Windows Script Host Object Model, Shell Controls and Automation, ADO
  6.1) hold no ActiveX controls; each on its own makes the host build fail, with no cause
  given, in the lane's staging, with the IDE's placeholders, with the `Build` folder made first,
  with `projects\` copied, as a package or a Standard EXE, win32 or win64. A reference to
  MSCOMCTL.OCX (32-bit only, registered by VB6) with `fusionAllTo32` builds the host, win32 and
  win64: `test/shots/fusion` uses it, so the shot needs MSCOMCTL.OCX registered. Not queued:
  Fusion is documented for controls; a failure message that names no cause may be worth an
  issue.

## Package server

Taken on BETA 1005, in both themes where the theme shows.

- **Setup `package-server`**: the sample with `test/shots/packages` (Greeting, a class to type
  `fmt.` into), signed out, TWINSERV's live list. Its APPDATA is `PACKAGE_ROOT\AppData\Roaming`,
  a neutral root for the path the two linked-package questions name (`f48a7254`, `8cf72685`);
  removed at the end. Every shot ticks what it shows and unticks it again before it leaves the
  dialog (the IDE deletes the project's copy of an embedded package at once, BETA 1005 asks
  nothing), and `packagesClean` empties the local packages folder (never the folder itself: the
  IDE writes into it and does not make it, and an export fails with an alert) and fails a shot
  when an earlier one left a package. Only `e2a65dfe` applies (the completion list needs the
  compiler to have the package).
- **The linked-package sequence is one project**, not two: the IDE asks "Local Package exists"
  whenever a package with a local copy is ticked (`g_UserPackagesInfo`), so tick, untick
  Embedded (the IDE writes the copy), untick, tick again gives `f48a7254`, and Download it from
  TWINSERV (EMBED) then Embedded unticked gives `8cf72685`. One IDE per setup could not run two
  projects in order anyway.
- **`f66fb240`** (setup `settings-linked`): the sample with `test/shots/settings/linked.json`,
  linking OLEGuids, and an APPDATA with no copy: as a project opened on a machine without the
  package. Opening reaches it; Restart the compiler (from MEMORY) with the copy deleted hangs at
  5% then UNAVAILABLE for good, Apply Changes (from FILE) does not: an IDE defect, not yet in
  BUGS-TO-REPORT.md.
- **`db4636f6`** (setup `package-check`): the IDE downloads only the newest build, and a package
  imported from a file has no publisher, which the check needs. The tool downloads OLEGuids
  1.0.0.9 from TWINSERV by the IDE's own address, unpacks it into the staged project's
  `Packages\OLEGuids` and adds the reference the IDE writes for a TWINSERV package: the check
  on load says 1.0.0.10 is available. OLEGuids replaces WinDevLib in the page (WinDevLib
  publishes weekly, so its line would change every run, and it is 23 MB).
- **`a1331a0e`** is the Enabled Libraries tab with the embedded package's tick ringed: BETA 1005
  no longer asks "Also remove the imported package ...", and `Updating a package.md` says the copy
  is deleted at once.
- **`packPublishPackage1`** kept: `packagePublisherPublish` opens the sign-in form when no
  publisher is signed in, before the confirmation box.
- **`e749e10f`**: the gear is the Project Explorer's (the old picture's toolbar gear is gone);
  the dialog is shown whole with the gear beside it (2324 px wide; a smaller page does not make
  the dialog narrower, it covers the gear). The full dialog fills Available COM References
  (hidden, its text in the page), whose paths name the user: the shot waits for that list and
  then renames the user in the page.
- **`f48a7254`** starts at the question's left edge: the row being ticked shows an animated
  spinner no two captures hold alike. **`e2a65dfe`**: the completion list is the IDE's own
  (`.debugConsoleEntryIntellisenseBox`), shows types as `...` until the compiler gives them
  (now and then never: the dot is retyped), and is placed by the list the name before the dot
  opened unless that is closed first.
- **Compiler crash, not narrowed**: about 3 runs in 10 of the setup, an Apply that embeds or
  removes CSharpishStringFormater meets `NATIVE EXCEPTION: ACCESS_VIOLATION {no-basic-code}
  [twinBASIC_win32.dll+0010BD3F]`; ten probe cycles of the same steps did not reproduce it. Not
  queued. `applyChanges` clears the DEBUG CONSOLE first, so one crash does not fail every later
  Apply, and prints the crash lines.
- All pictures are page captures, so the page-text check for the user name covers them.

## Not of the IDE

Taken on BETA 1005.

- **`16833fae`** (setup `import`): the sample open, and `test/shots/vbp` (ImportDemo: a form,
  a module, `..\Shared\modShared.bas` for `{PARENT-FOLDER}`) staged with CRLF on
  `PACKAGE_ROOT\Projects` (the path the dialog shows, `C:\tbshots\Projects\ImportDemo\ImportDemo.vbp`),
  with a `.res` the tool writes (`scripts/lib/res-file.mjs`: three icons and the fixture's
  manifest). The IDE's Open dialog is native, so the take calls `importFileByPath` with the
  file, what the IDE calls with the file chosen; the form's two files are ticked with real
  clicks. Cancel ends the import's compiler and the IDE then restarts its own, writing a
  DEBUG CONSOLE line that names the work folder: the take waits for the restart and clears the
  console, or the light pass's page fails the user-name check. Both themes (the title bar).
- **`IDE/Images/Webpage.png`** (setup `webpage`): the pane's page is a second WebView2 on the
  IDE's DevTools port (its own `page` target, title the page's). The take sets
  `liveWebpanelSettings` in the page (the IDE's defaults, zoom 0.7, with
  `https://docs.twinbasic.com/`; the user's saved settings are read by the IDE but never shown
  or written), floats the pane at 340x500, captures the pane's target with
  `setDeviceMetricsOverride` at the body's size less 2 (the host puts the WebView2 one pixel
  inside it, `syncPosition`) at 2x, and pastes it into the page's capture of the pane. The page's
  `prefers-color-scheme` follows the picture's theme, so the dark picture shows the docs dark.
  The IDE itself draws a host screenshot into the pane when something covers it
  (`AskForAdditionalWebview2Screenshot`, `checkObscured`), at the host's 1.5x: not used.
  The target's text is searched for the user name with the page's.
- **`94490c87`, `ac019c1a`** (setup `web`): no IDE; puppeteer's Chrome started by
  `launchOnDesktop` on a private desktop (not headless, so its user agent is the ordinary one)
  with `CalculateNativeWinOcclusion` and the backgrounding of occluded windows off: on a desktop
  nobody sees, Chrome otherwise draws no frame and a capture waits forever or holds a blank page.
  Both `once`, at 2x, light. A clip is in document coordinates (`pageClip`): nothing else in the
  tool scrolls. Microsoft's page rebuilds itself after `load` and puts its scroll back to the
  top, so `scrolledTo` waits for the page to stay still and scrolls until the element stays
  put. Its cookie banner is at the top of the page and outside the crop; nothing is clicked on
  it. The arrow and ring are the overlay's. The GitHub page is the repository's release list,
  whose first release is the newest (`releases/latest` skips pre-releases); Assets is opened
  with a real click. Its numbers (size, "yesterday", the version) are the day's, so the FAQ's alt
  does not name them; its install-size entry says about 40 MB and 120 MB (the BETA 1005 folder
  less the runtime's `.WebView2` data folder).
- `test/addin/help.test.mjs` fetches `/favicon.png` as its sample PNG, so `favicon.png` must stay
  a PNG.

## Machine state in the pictures (owner, 2026-10-08)

- **The IDE's settings** (View's ticks, IDE Options' values, the debugger options, user panel
  layouts and keyboard groups) are set to their defaults **in the page only** — `liveIDEOptions`
  and the like, in memory, never saved — so no picture shows the user's choices and nothing is
  written to the registry.
- **About's licence line**: the tool waits for `licenceIsSet` before opening About, so it shows
  the edition, never NOT READY.
- **The language tick** stays on whatever language the IDE runs in.
- **`llvmdoc2`** shows the default thread count, 1 (the picture's earlier 10 was its author's
  setting).

## Project-setup pictures (owner, 2026-10-08)

Project Settings, the panels, Project Explorer, Sample 6, Sample 15 and Global Search. In
BETA 997 Sample 6's control images are in the CustomControls package's Miscellaneous folder, not
the project's, and the tutorial says so.

- **History's times are fixed in the page**, as the recent lists are, and its project is a
  project-made fixture.
- **The glyph crops** are element clips, 2x, shown at half size.
- **A machine or account value becomes a neutral one** (Publisher blank or a project-made name;
  the COM list shows this machine's, under the username check), and prose that names the old
  value is changed to match.
- **An old-design picture is retaken in today's look**, with alt text and prose rechecked.

## Designers, code and composites (owner, 2026-10-09)

- **Composites** lay their parts out on the IDE's background in the picture's theme, with a gap,
  code on the left and the panel on the right, one red arrow across.
- **Replica select lists** take one style: a white list, 1 px grey border, the IDE's font, the
  current option on mid-grey `#6E6E6E` with white text.
- **The CustomControls tutorial's pictures** come from a project-made fixture,
  `test/shots/customcontrols/`, referencing the CustomControls package, with a class using the
  tutorial's names (`MyField`, `MyEnum`); the Toolbox may list two grids.
- **No mouse pointer** is drawn in any picture.
- The designer pictures come from a `designer` setup that stages files onto the sample fixture at
  run time; controls are put on forms by hand-written `.tbform` files.
- **Designers and the Format menu.** The report is made in the page by Sources > Add > Add
  Windows Report. Toolbox_Report is the *docked* Toolbox: a floating one lists every tool even
  with a report active (`reportDesignerMode` is set on `#bodyInner`, which a floating panel is
  outside) -- a possible IDE defect, not yet reproduced or queued. After the Format shots the
  designer marks frmControls changed with no control moved (cause unknown), so those shots close
  it with Discard Changes.
- **Properties and Toolbox.** Setup `forms` is `designer` without the add-in;
  `settings-webview2` also stages `test/shots/designer/webview2/` (frmWeb, a WebView2 `Web1`
  with no DocumentURL, so the designer loads nothing), since only that setup references the
  package. `MyOwnIcon.ico` is the template's icon copied at run time. 8611d12a's panels are put
  in place by `restorePanelLayout` in the page and the default layout put back after; the crop
  stops at History's title bar (its entries carry the real time) and left of the IDE's title.
  In 997 PROPERTIES is grouped by category only (Anchors in LAYOUT, WebView2's own properties in
  GENERAL), and **a property's description is never shown at the panel's foot**: it goes to the
  designer's own `.proprtiesBoxFooter` inside the code panel, not the tool window -- a possible
  IDE defect, not reproduced or queued. The WebView2 tutorial points to the class reference
  instead. A floating Toolbox for a form lists what the docked one does.
- **Replicas and composites.** **Replicas** are the overlay's `list` primitive: the
  select's options, current index and font, drawn as SVG at its bottom-left in the owner's
  style, a scroll bar when only a window of rows shows; its rows are anchors. **Composites** are
  `scripts/lib/shot-composite.mjs`: each part captured alone (a code part is the real editor
  with the other lines hidden and the line, bracket and occurrence highlights off in the page;
  a panel part a cut-out of PROPERTIES), anchors resolved while it shows, then laid out in
  columns 40 px apart on the IDE background, drawn one to one, one arrow, captured. The fixture
  `test/shots/customcontrols/` (setup `customcontrols`, two parts) has controls `MyGrid` and
  `MyButton` and classes `GridColumn` and `MyButtonState` (the package has `Column`). 1b adds
  ` = 42` in the page and reopens the form: an open designer never takes a new default and
  shows no RESYNC (the page's TIP says it does; only a default value was tested). A custom
  control's Left/Top/Width/Height read in twips, its `PixelCount` fields in pixels.
- **Code views.** `codePart` wraps `codeLines` (any open file; `include`, `extraRight`,
  `annotate`, `hover`, `view`, `bare`). Setup `code` stages `test/shots/code/` (ConstantsDemo,
  FlagsDemo); `buildConfiguration` changes `buildConfigSelector`, waits for the greying to move,
  and clears the DEBUG CONSOLE, whose compiler-restart line names the user's folder. Inline
  hints need *Always show IDE Inline Code Hints* (`codeHintsVisibility2`, off by default), set
  in the page only. The ClassId hint shows only for `[ ClassId () ]` above a class, put in by
  `executeEdits`: typed, the IDE reformats it to `[ClassId()]` with no hint. The JSON view shows
  the file's text, so `frmCustomJson.tbform` holds `"MyField": 0` (in `frmCustom` it would
  override `= 42` in 1b). Setup `sample9` opens Sample 9, whose `WebView_Create` is unchanged.

## Pictures as SVG

`--svg` writes each picture a second time, as `X.svg` (and `X.light.svg`), drawn from the page
the PNG was just captured from, and the build shows it in place of the PNG
([WIP.Build.md, Pictures as SVG](WIP.Build.md#pictures-as-svg)).

**Owner's decisions (2026-10-09 and 10):**

- Text is real text, in per-picture subsets of the fonts the IDE drew it with, cut by fontTools
  (`scripts/subset_font.py`), hinting kept. Glyph outlines were rejected (they render poorly);
  harfbuzzjs was tried and removed ("don't mess with harfbuzz").
- The PNG and the SVG are both committed. One SVG per theme: a single SVG switching on CSS
  variables and a `#light` fragment was proposed and dropped.
- Pages name `X.png` and the build substitutes; `png` in the attribute block keeps the PNG.
- `picture_svg` in `_config.yml` per output: online and book on, offline (and so the help
  archive) off.
- No `<picture>` fallback for old browsers; the per-picture `png` instead.

**How a picture is drawn** (`scripts/svgshot/`):

- `capture.mjs`'s `svgOfPage` reads, while the page is as captured: a DOM snapshot (layout, text
  fragments, computed styles, paint order); then, from a measuring layer added after it, each
  font's ascent and the fonts Chromium drew each run with (`CSS.getPlatformFontsForNode`); the
  canvases' pixels, the web fonts' bytes, the annotation layer as XML; and the styles of each
  scrolling box's scrollbar parts.
- `snapshot-svg.mjs`'s `renderSvg` makes one paint item per layout object, in the snapshot's
  paint order. Boxes are snapped to whole CSS px, since the IDE lays out at 1x and is only drawn
  at 2x; text, and the text a control draws, keeps its exact position. What the snapshot lacks is
  drawn as replicas of what Chromium paints: a closed `<select>`, a checkbox and a radio button,
  an input's and a textarea's text (scrolled), and scrollbars styled with `::-webkit-scrollbar`.
- **An embedded image keeps its pixels and any notice of whose it is, and nothing else**
  (owner, 2026-10-10). `renderSvg` passes each through `compactImage` from
  `scripts/lib/compact-image.mjs`, which `scripts/imagestrip/` matches; what it keeps and why
  is in [WIP.Build.md](WIP.Build.md) beside `imagestrip`, and `test/compact-image.test.mjs`
  tests it. The icons whose sRGB profile it drops decode to the same pixels in Edge 155 and
  Chromium 148; a `gAMA` 1.0 control does not. The 318 by 346 pixels of a 16-pixel icon such
  as tB-Red are the IDE's own asset at its own size, and stay so (owner, 2026-10-10).
- `fonts.mjs` gives each run's characters to the font files Chromium used for them, and
  `subset_font.py` cuts each file to the characters drawn, as WOFF2.
- `diff.mjs` renders the SVG as an `<img>` at 2x and compares it with the PNG by luminance and
  alpha, a shift of one device pixel allowed, so that the PNGs' ClearType fringes mostly cancel
  out.
- **The SVG's size is the PNG's.** A clip half a CSS pixel past a whole one (a menu 168.5 wide)
  is captured a device pixel short of it, 168 wide, from the same origin; an SVG of the whole
  clip shows the half of the edge the PNG cuts off. That column alone put a small picture past
  the bar (a 16-pixel icon at 11%, a menu at 0.5%), so `capture` gives `svgOfPage` the clip
  with the PNG's width and height.
- **The bar** (`SVG_FAITHFUL` in `shoot_docs.mjs`): an SVG with more than 0.25% of its pixels 96
  grey levels or more off is not written, and an older one is removed. Anything not drawn falls
  to it.
- **One line** (`oneLine`). Git checks a picture's SVG out with CRLF where `core.autocrlf` says
  so, since no `.gitattributes` rule can tell it from a diagram's SVG. An SVG icon embedded as
  text and the annotation layer's XML hold line breaks; so each is written as the space an XML
  parser makes of a break inside a tag, or `&#10;` in text, the same character. A checkout then
  changes only the last line ending, which `keepSvg` ignores when it compares.

**Scrollbars.** The IDE styles every scrollbar with `::-webkit-scrollbar` rules
(`ide/styles.css`, coloured by theme variables), a second family under `.modalDialogContainer`.
`getComputedStyle` cannot name a scrollbar part or a state such as `:vertical`, and a rule's text
cannot be copied onto an element of the tool's own: Chromium drops a `var()` shorthand from
`cssText` once a longhand overrides part of it, as the thumb's `background-clip` does its
`background: var(...)`. So `scrollbarParts` gives each rule that styles this element's
scrollbars, for a moment, one more selector, matching a probe element per part with the
specificity of the selector it stands for; Chromium cascades and resolves the `var()`s, and the
rules are put back. The parts are laid out as Chromium's custom scrollbar theme does: a button's
length its `height` (vertical) or `width`, `auto` being the platform's scrollbar thickness, which
the page measures; the thumb as long as its share of the content, never shorter than its own
length, whose `auto` is 17 px (Windows' thumb length at 96 DPI; no page property shows it, and
the bench checks it); its place from the snapshot's scroll offset. A corner rule left with no
declaration (the IDE's `background-color: transaprent`) still gives the corner a style of its
own, transparent. The buttons' arrows blend into the track with `background-blend-mode:
hard-light`, drawn as an isolated group with `mix-blend-mode`.

**Drop-down lists.** The label is set from the box's exact position: a table cell can put a
select at x.5, where Chromium snaps the border to the pixel grid but not the text. It sits in the
content box less 4 px at the start and the arrow's 16 px box at the end, aligned by
`text-align-last`, else `text-align` (a select does not take it from its cell), and is cut at
that box. The chevron is 8 by 4 px, stroked 2 px wide, centred in the 16 px box at the padding
box's right edge whatever the padding, its top 2 px above the box's middle rounded down: fitted
against Chromium's own arrow in Edge.

**Underlines** (`decoratingBoxes`, `underlineBand`, `inkBand` in `snapshot-svg.mjs`). A text
decoration is not inherited: the converter walks up from the text and takes the line of every box
that sets one, through blocks, stopping after an atomic inline box, a float or a positioned box.
Fitted in Edge 155 on `bench/decoration.html`, in whole CSS px since Chromium snaps the line at
1x: the baseline rounded; an auto thickness `max(1, floor(size/10))`, a given one rounded; an auto
offset `max(1, ceil(size/10/2))` below the baseline, a given one rounded with no gap of its own
(the package-server tip is 13 px with the IDE's `text-underline-offset: 2px`, so 2 px down, 1
thick); the sizes and the colour (`text-decoration-color`) from the box that sets the line. Chromium
cuts a gap round each descender, as wide as the unrounded thickness on each side; `capture.mjs`
finds the ink by drawing the run 16 times as large on a canvas in the measuring layer
(`convert.mjs`, which runs no measuring layer, draws lines whole). Reported as not drawn:
overline, line-through, every style but solid, and `text-underline-position` other than auto.
`test/svgshot.test.mjs` holds the fitted figures.

**A background image is sized by its bytes** (`naturalSize`), not by the type its URL names:
the IDE calls a JPEG and a BMP `image/png`. The About dialog's EXCALIBUR logo is such a JPEG,
drawn with `background-size: contain`; read as a PNG, its JFIF header gave 4,718,592 by about 4.3
billion pixels, and the logo would come out 0.054 px wide.

**Frames** (owner, 2026-10-10: cross-origin frames in general). A frame of the same site (the
docked help pane: the documentation on another `localhost` port) is in the IDE's process, and
`DOMSnapshot.captureSnapshot` returns its document beside the page's: the `<iframe>` node's
`contentDocumentIndex` names it, and its boxes are in its own coordinates. `decodeSnapshot`
decodes every document and hangs a frame's on its `<iframe>` node (`node.frame`); `renderSvg`
draws it at the iframe's place in paint order, as one group moved to the iframe's content box
less the frame's scroll, clipped to it, scaled when the frame is zoomed (its `innerWidth` against
the box; `unzoom` puts boxes Chromium gives in the parent's px back into the frame's), over its
canvas colour (the root's background, else the body's, else none) and under its viewport's
scrollbars. `svgOfPage` measures each frame in an isolated world of its own
(`Page.createIsolatedWorld`), so its `@font-face` rules and styles apply; one `PictureFonts`
serves the whole picture. A frame of another site is a target of its own and is not in the
snapshot: it is reported as "a frame of another process" (Help_Window's, the Webpage pane's).

**Web fonts** are found by CSS font matching on the run's `font-family` list, style and weight
(`webFontFiles`, in the page), not by the face's own name: the site's Inter calls itself "Inter
Variable", and the last rule of a family was its italic file. A variable WOFF2 is read in
`fonts.mjs` and cut at each weight the picture uses (`subset_font.py`'s `weight`). A font
fontTools cannot cut gets no face and its text falls back, reported as "text in a font that
could not be cut" (`subset_font.py` answers that job with an error instead of failing the run).

**The platform's own scrollbar** (`paintNativeScrollbars`) is the Fluent one Edge and the
IDE's WebView2 draw (on this Windows 10 machine too): 15 px, a round-ended 9 px thumb, arrows 9.5 by 4.75, `scrollbar-color` where it is set, else the
light or dark default by `color-scheme`; the docs site's dark theme sets `scrollbar-color`, which
turns its own `::-webkit-scrollbar` rules off. **A focus ring** (`outline-style: auto`,
`paintFocusRing`) is a 2 px band in the outline colour and a 1 px white one outside it. Both were
fitted in Edge on bench pages of their own.

**The bench** (`node scripts/svgshot/bench.mjs`, outside every gate, needs Edge and fontTools)
draws the pages under `scripts/svgshot/bench/` (scrollbars, native scrollbars, drop-down lists,
underlines, focus rings, frames) with the converter
and compares them with the browser's own picture: in Edge, whose Chromium is the IDE's WebView2's
(Puppeteer's trails it, and draws the select's arrow otherwise), laid out at 1x and drawn at 2x
as the IDE is, text without ClearType. Each page is held to the figures recorded in
`bench/baseline.json` (`--update` records them): no page comes out exact, and a fixed limit
missed a fault fixed while the bench was written (arrows a quarter too tall moved a page from
0.025% to 0.064%). `node scripts/svgshot/pixels.mjs <png> x y w h --beside <png>` prints a
rectangle of two pictures as letters, one per colour: how an edge, a stroke or a blend came out.
A new replica gets a page there.

**Not drawn yet:** a thin platform scrollbar (`scrollbar-width: thin`), a zoomed frame's
scrollbars, a textarea's resize grip, a number input's spin buttons, an indeterminate checkbox,
conic gradients, the 2011 `-webkit-radial-gradient`, `filter: hue-rotate`, an inset shadow's
blur, an inline `<svg>` in the page other than the annotation layer (the help pane's gear, a few
hundred pixels), and a frame of another process: Help_Window's and the Webpage pane's (which
`webpage` pastes into the PNG from its own capture), so those pictures stay PNG. Of the `web`
setup's two pages, the WebView2 download page (`94490c87`) is kept as PNG: its font is one
fontTools cannot cut (`'.notdef'`), and its icons, drop-down lists and annotation do not come out
either (not looked into: it is Microsoft's page, taken once). Drawn wrongly: a collapsed table
border, doubled (the IDE has none). A canvas is a raster (the editor's minimap is drawn with
`putImageData`). The run reports each under "not drawn".
