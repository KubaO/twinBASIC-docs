const USAGE = `usage: node scripts/svgshot/replay.mjs [--only <regex>] [--bundles <dir>] [--out <dir>] [--diffs <dir>] [--jobs N] [-h, --help]

Draws each picture's SVG again from the bundle shoot_docs.mjs --svg saved when it
took the picture, with the converter as it is now, and writes it beside its PNG
as shoot_docs.mjs does: written when no more than ${SVG_FAITHFUL}% of its pixels
are far off the PNG's and its bytes differ from the file's, else not written and
an older one removed. Takes no picture and starts no IDE; needs Python with
fontTools, as --svg does.

A picture whose PNG is not the one its bundle was taken with, whose bundle lacks a
computed style the converter now reads, or for which the converter asks something
its bundle cannot answer, is left as it is and listed as needing a retake, with
the shoot_docs.mjs command that takes them again.

  --only <regex>   only the pictures whose path under docs (with .light for a
                   light one) matches
  --bundles <dir>  the bundle cache (default .svgshot-bundles in the repository)
  --out <dir>      the folder the pictures are in (default docs)
  --diffs <dir>    write each SVG's difference map there, as <name>.svg-diff.png
  --recheck        compare every SVG with its PNG, also one that is the same
                   bytes as the file (which the bar passed when it was written)
  --jobs N         processes drawing at once, each with a browser of its own
                   (default: half the logical processors, at most 8)
  -h, --help       print this text and exit

Exit codes:
  0  every picture was drawn again: written, unchanged, or left as a PNG
  1  a picture needs a retake, could not be drawn, or its SVG holds the Windows
     user name
  2  the tool could not run: a refused command line, no bundle cache, no browser,
     or a crash`;
