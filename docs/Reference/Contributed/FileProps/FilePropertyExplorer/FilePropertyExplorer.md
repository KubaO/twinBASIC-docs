# FilePropertyExplorer class
{: .no_toc }

A predeclared factory class that opens a file and returns a [**FileProperties**](../FileProperties/FileProperties) collection of its Windows shell properties.

**FilePropertyExplorer** is a Virtual-COM wrapper around the Windows shell property handler infrastructure. It exposes the operating system's extended file properties --- the same data the Windows Explorer **Details** pane shows for a file. Common examples include audio duration and bitrate on MP3 files, EXIF camera settings on JPEG images, and author or revision information on Office documents.

The class carries the `[ PredeclaredId ]` attribute, so it acts as a default instance and its methods are callable without creating an explicit object variable:

```tb
Dim Props As FileProperties
Set Props = FilePropertyExplorer.OpenFile("C:\Music\track.mp3")
```

* TOC
{:toc}

## Methods

### BrowseAndOpenFile
{: .no_toc }

Displays a system file-open dialog and returns a [**FileProperties**](../FileProperties/FileProperties) collection for the file the user selects.

Syntax: **FilePropertyExplorer**.**BrowseAndOpenFile** ( [ *WriteSupport* ] ) **As FileProperties**

*WriteSupport*
: *optional* A **Boolean**. Pass **True** to open the file with write access so that [**FileProperty.Value**](../FileProperty/Value) can be assigned. Default: **False** (read-only).

Returns **Nothing** if the user cancels the dialog.

```tb
Dim Props As FileProperties
Set Props = FilePropertyExplorer.BrowseAndOpenFile()

If Not Props Is Nothing Then
    Dim i As Long
    For i = 0 To Props.Count - 1
        Dim Prop As FileProperty
        Set Prop = Props.Item(i)
        Debug.Print Prop.NameDesc & " = " & Prop.ValueDesc
    Next i
End If
```

### OpenFile
{: .no_toc }

Opens a file by path and returns a [**FileProperties**](../FileProperties/FileProperties) collection of its shell properties.

Syntax: **FilePropertyExplorer**.**OpenFile** ( *FilePath* [, *WriteSupport* ] ) **As FileProperties**

*FilePath*
: *required* A **String** containing the absolute path to the file.

*WriteSupport*
: *optional* A **Boolean**. Pass **True** to open the file with write access so that [**FileProperty.Value**](../FileProperty/Value) can be assigned. Default: **False** (read-only).

Returns **Nothing** if the file cannot be opened or if the path does not exist.

```tb
Dim Props As FileProperties
Set Props = FilePropertyExplorer.OpenFile("C:\Pictures\photo.jpg")

If Not Props Is Nothing Then
    Debug.Print "File: " & Props.FilePath
    Debug.Print "Property count: " & Props.Count

    ' Look up a specific property by system name:
    Dim Prop As FileProperty
    Set Prop = Props.Item("System.Photo.CameraModel")
    If Not Prop Is Nothing Then
        Debug.Print "Camera: " & Prop.ValueDesc
    End If
End If
```

## Remarks

**FilePropertyExplorer** uses a Virtual-COM library --- a self-contained native-code COM object loaded into memory without registering a DLL. The library supports both 32-bit and 64-bit hosts.

The shell property handler infrastructure requires Windows 2000 or later. On Vista and later the write path (passing `WriteSupport = True`) uses the Vista-era `IPropertyStore` API; on earlier systems write access is not available.

> [!NOTE]
> Write support for [**FileProperty.Value**](../FileProperty/Value) requires Windows Vista or later. On Windows XP the `WriteSupport` parameter is accepted but property writes have no effect.

## Example

This example opens a file-open dialog, then prints all shell properties for the selected file to the Debug console.

```tb
Sub ShowFileProps()
    Dim Props As FileProperties
    Set Props = FilePropertyExplorer.BrowseAndOpenFile()

    If Props Is Nothing Then
        Debug.Print "No file selected."
        Exit Sub
    End If

    Debug.Print "File: " & Props.FilePath
    Debug.Print "Properties: " & Props.Count & Chr(10)

    Dim i As Long
    For i = 0 To Props.Count - 1
        Dim Prop As FileProperty
        Set Prop = Props.Item(i)
        Debug.Print Prop.NameDesc & " (" & Prop.Name & ")" & " = " & Prop.ValueDesc
    Next i
End Sub
```
