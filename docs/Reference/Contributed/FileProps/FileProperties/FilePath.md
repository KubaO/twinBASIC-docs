# FilePath
{: .no_toc }

Returns a **String** containing the full file path of the file that was opened. Read-only.

Syntax: *object*.**FilePath**

*object*
: *required* An object expression that evaluates to a **FileProperties** object.

The value is the path that was passed to [**FilePropertyExplorer.OpenFile**](../FilePropertyExplorer/OpenFile) or selected through [**FilePropertyExplorer.BrowseAndOpenFile**](../FilePropertyExplorer/BrowseAndOpenFile) when the **FileProperties** collection was created. The path is returned exactly as the shell resolved it; no normalisation is applied.

### Example

This example opens a file and prints its path and property count to the Debug console.

```tb
Dim fp As FileProperties
Set fp = FilePropertyExplorer.OpenFile("C:\Users\Public\sample.mp3")
Debug.Print "File: " & fp.FilePath
Debug.Print "Properties: " & fp.Count
```
