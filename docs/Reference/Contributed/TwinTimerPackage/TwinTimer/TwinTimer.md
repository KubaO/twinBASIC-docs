# TwinTimer class
{: .no_toc }

A timer class that fires a **Timer** event at a repeating interval and reports the total elapsed time in milliseconds since the timer started.

**TwinTimer** uses the Win32 `SetTimer` / `KillTimer` API directly and is not tied to any form or control. It can be instantiated in any module---standard modules, class modules, and form code alike---and the **Timer** event is raised on the main thread through the Windows message pump, so no cross-thread marshalling is needed.

The elapsed-time counter passed to the **Timer** event is a monotonically increasing **LongLong** expressed in milliseconds. The implementation handles the 49.7-day rollover of the underlying `GetTickCount` clock automatically, so the counter continues to increase correctly over long-running sessions.

```tb
Private WithEvents Timer1 As TwinTimer

Private Sub Form_Load()
    Set Timer1 = New TwinTimer
    Timer1.Interval = 1000   ' fire every second
End Sub

Private Sub Timer1_Timer(ByVal ElapsedTime As LongLong)
    Label1.Caption = "Elapsed: " & ElapsedTime & " ms"
End Sub
```

## Properties

### Enabled
{: .no_toc }

Whether the timer fires **Timer** events. **Boolean**. Default: **True**.

Setting **Enabled** to **False** stops the Win32 timer and suppresses **Timer** events. Setting it back to **True** restarts the timer; the elapsed-time counter resets on the next tick.

Setting **Enabled** while **Interval** is `0` has no effect---the timer cannot run with a zero interval.

Syntax: *object*.**Enabled** [ = *value* ]

*value*
: A **Boolean** (or value convertible to **Boolean**). **True** to allow events; **False** to suppress them.

> [!NOTE]
> **Enabled** defaults to **True** at construction. A freshly constructed **TwinTimer** with **Interval** = `0` (the initial default) does not fire until **Interval** is set to a positive value.

### Interval
{: .no_toc }

The number of milliseconds between successive **Timer** events. **Long**. Default: `0`.

Setting **Interval** to a positive value restarts the underlying Win32 timer with the new period and resets the elapsed-time counter. Setting it to `0` stops the timer without changing **Enabled**.

Syntax: *object*.**Interval** [ = *milliseconds* ]

*milliseconds*
: A non-negative **Long**. A value of `0` stops the timer. A negative value raises run-time error 380 (Invalid property value).

> [!NOTE]
> The Win32 `SetTimer` function has a minimum resolution determined by the system timer resolution, typically 15--16 ms on standard Windows configurations. Specifying a shorter interval does not guarantee sub-15 ms accuracy.

## Events

### Timer
{: .no_toc }

Raised each time the interval elapses.

Syntax: *object*\_**Timer** ( *ElapsedTime* **As LongLong** )

*ElapsedTime*
: A **LongLong** giving the total number of milliseconds since the timer started. On the very first tick after the timer starts (or restarts), *ElapsedTime* is `0`. On each subsequent tick it reflects the cumulative milliseconds measured since that first tick.

The value is derived from the `dwTime` parameter supplied by `WM_TIMER` (equivalent to `GetTickCount` at the moment the timer message was dispatched). The class accounts for the 49.7-day `GetTickCount` rollover so *ElapsedTime* continues to increase correctly without wrapping.

```tb
Private Sub Timer1_Timer(ByVal ElapsedTime As LongLong)
    ' ElapsedTime is 0 on the first tick, then increases by ~Interval each tick.
    Debug.Print "Tick at " & ElapsedTime & " ms"
End Sub
```

## Example

This example creates a countdown that stops itself after 10 seconds.

```tb
Private WithEvents Countdown As TwinTimer

Private Sub Form_Load()
    Set Countdown = New TwinTimer
    Countdown.Interval = 500   ' check every 500 ms
End Sub

Private Sub Countdown_Timer(ByVal ElapsedTime As LongLong)
    Dim SecondsLeft As Long
    SecondsLeft = 10 - CLng(ElapsedTime \ 1000)
    If SecondsLeft <= 0 Then
        Countdown.Enabled = False
        Label1.Caption = "Done."
    Else
        Label1.Caption = "Stopping in " & SecondsLeft & " second(s)..."
    End If
End Sub
```
