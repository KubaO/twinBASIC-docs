# TwinTimerPackage Package
{: .no_toc }

The **TwinTimerPackage** contributed package provides a Win32-backed timer class that fires a **Timer** event at a repeating interval and reports the total elapsed time in milliseconds. Unlike the built-in VB **Timer** control, **TwinTimer** does not require a form or control container and can be instantiated from any module.

  - [Interval](TwinTimer/Interval) -- returns or sets the number of milliseconds between successive Timer events
