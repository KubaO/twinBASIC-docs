# TBMAN module
{: .no_toc }

A standard module that exposes a pre-instantiated [**cRes**](../cRes/cRes) object as a public variable, providing package-wide access to resource loading without requiring a separate **cRes** instance.

## Members

### Res

A pre-instantiated **cRes** object. **cRes**.

```tb
Public Res As New cRes
```

**Res** is initialised automatically when the module is first accessed. It provides the same interface as a manually constructed **cRes** instance: [**Read**](../cRes/Read), [**ReturnBytes**](../cRes/ReturnBytes), [**ReturnString**](../cRes/ReturnString), [**ReturnHex**](../cRes/ReturnHex), [**ReturnBase64**](../cRes/ReturnBase64), and [**ReturnPicture**](../cRes/ReturnPicture).

> [!NOTE]
> **TBMAN.Res** is a single shared instance for the entire project. Calling **Res.Read** replaces its internal byte buffer. If multiple callers read different resources in the same execution path, use separate **cRes** instances rather than sharing **TBMAN.Res**.

## Example

This example loads a PNG resource and assigns it to a **PictureBox** control.

```tb
Private Sub Form_Load()
    Picture1.Picture = TBMAN.Res.Read(101, "PNG").ReturnPicture()
End Sub
```
