# ReturnPicture
{: .no_toc }

Returns the loaded resource bytes as an **IPictureDisp** object.

Syntax: *object*.**ReturnPicture**()

**ReturnPicture** passes the raw bytes stored by the preceding [**Read**](Read) call to the twinBASIC built-in **LoadPicture** function, which interprets the bytes as an image and returns an **IPictureDisp** COM object. The returned picture can be assigned directly to the **Picture** property of any standard VB control that accepts one (such as **PictureBox** or **Image**).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> [**Read**](Read) must be called before **ReturnPicture**. Calling **ReturnPicture** without first loading a resource results in **LoadPicture** receiving an empty byte array, which will raise a runtime error.

### Example

This example loads a PNG image embedded as a custom resource and assigns it to a **PictureBox** control.

```tb
Private Sub Form_Load()
    Dim res As New cRes
    res.Read "MY_IMAGE", "CUSTOM"
    Picture1.Picture = res.ReturnPicture()
End Sub
```
